Some Counting Tasks - C++ Project

This C++ application shows how to utilise `for` loops to carry out a range of counting jobs.
With programmable start/end positions and step values, it displays several methods for counting both up and down.
What the Program Does:
----------------------
When run, the program prints the following sequences to the console:
1. Counting up from 0 to 50 (in steps of 1)
2. Counting down from 50 to 0 (in steps of 1)
3. Counting up from 30 to 50 (in steps of 1)
4. Counting down from 50 to 10 (in steps of 2)
5. Counting up from 100 to 200 (in steps of 5)

Each section is clearly labeled to help users understand what is happening.
